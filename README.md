# E-Commerce Product Recommendation System

## Overview

The **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System** provides personalized product recommendations to users of an e-commerce platform. The recommendation system is based on **collaborative filtering** using the **K-D Tree** nearest neighbor search algorithm.

Users are recommended products based on the behavior of other similar users in the system. The project is implemented in **Python** with **Flask** as the backend framework for providing a RESTful API.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Flask** (Web Framework)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Library)
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **Numpy** (Numerical Computing)
- **K-D Tree** (Nearest Neighbor Search)
- **Heapq** (Priority Queue for Product Recommendations)
- **Render** (Deployment Platform)

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on user similarity.
- **K-D Tree Nearest Neighbor Search**: Efficiently finds similar users using K-D Trees.
- **API for Recommendations**: Exposes a Flask API that returns recommended products for a given user.
- **Caching**: Uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to speed up frequent queries.
- **Heap-based Priority Queue**: Prioritizes recommendations based on user product interactions.

## Running the Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd recommendation-system
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following command to create the virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 6: Run the Flask Application

To start the Flask application, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can now access the API to get product recommendations.

### Step 7: Test the Recommendation System

You can test the recommendations by visiting:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommendations?user_id=1
```

You should receive a JSON response with the recommended products for the given `user_id`.

## API Documentation

### Endpoint: `/recommendations`

**Method**: `GET`

**Parameters**:
- `user_id`: The user ID for whom you want to fetch recommendations (integer).

**Response**:

The API will return a JSON response containing the recommended products for the user:

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "recommended_products": [102, 103, 104]
}
```

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
/recommendation-system
├── /data
│   └── user_data.csv          # Sample dataset containing user-product interactions
├── /env                       # Virtual environment
├── /requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
├── /app.py                    # Flask application to serve recommendations
├── /recommendation.py         # Logic for recommendation engine (collaborative filtering)
├── /README.md                 # This README file
├── /Procfile                  # Render deployment configuration
└── /LICENSE                   # License file (optional)
```

### `recommendation.py`

This file contains the logic for the **recommendation engine**. It loads user data, processes it into a user-item interaction matrix, and applies collaborative filtering to suggest products.

### `app.py`

This file contains the **Flask web application**. It exposes an API endpoint (`/recommendations`) to fetch product recommendations for a given user.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Render

You can deploy this project on **Render**, a platform for deploying web apps. To deploy, follow these steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `Procfile` with the following content to specify how to run the app:
   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```

3. Create an account on **Render** (https://render.com/) if you don’t have one.

4. Connect your GitHub repository to **Render**.

5. Select the Python template for deployment and link it to your repository.

6. Click **Deploy** and wait for Render to build and deploy your app.

After deployment, you will receive a public URL for your API.

## Testing the Application

### Unit Tests

To ensure your application works as expected, you can write and run unit tests. Example tests are provided in `test_app.py`, which tests the `/recommendations` API endpoint.

Run the tests with the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_app.py
```

### Test the Recommendations Endpoint

You can also test the recommendation system manually using a tool like **Postman** or **curl**:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommendations?user_id=1"
```

This should return the recommended products for the user with `user_id=1`.

## Final Notes

This project is a simple implementation of an **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System** using **collaborative filtering** and **Flask**. You can enhance it by adding features like **content-based filtering**, **hybrid recommendation models**, or integrating it with a real e-commerce platform’s database.
